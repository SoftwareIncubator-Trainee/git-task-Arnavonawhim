Hello, My name is Arnav Agrawal. 
I am a 2nd year at AKGEC doing Btech in CS with huge aspirations. I genuinely like CS and didn't do it forcefully so I can't even blame anyone when 
I suck at coding.
I Love exploring AI but hate the maths I have to do to get to the point of making good money from AI.
