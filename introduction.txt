Hello, My name is Arnav Agrawal. 
I am a 2nd year at AKGEC doing Btech in CS with huge aspirations. I genuinely like CS and didn't do it forcefully so I can't even blame anyone when 
I suck at coding.
I Love exploring AI but hate the maths I have to do to get to the point of making good money from AI.


More About Arnav:
I have a good general idea of many skills but I lack in specialization in one. 
I have done C/C++ python C# and countless libraries of python.
Some python libraries I have used: Numpy,Pandas,pytorch,tensorflow,matplot,seaborn,scikitlearn,streamlit,transformers,pydpf2,speech_recognition,openai and many more
But I am barely confident in any one of those yet.
My hobbies are:
socialising to refuel, trying to be in a workaholic mindset but not fully achieving it, volleyball, game development and wanting to stress about money.
